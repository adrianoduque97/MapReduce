eye 1
contact 1
will 1
generally 1
assist 1
a 1
member 1
to 1
persuade 1
an 1

they 1
lose 1
the 1
attention 1

the 1
audience. 1
4.2.6 1
the 1

at 1
a 1

which 1
are 1
appropriate 1

that 1
they 1
should 1
not 1
discriminate 1
against 1
a 1
member 1
simply 1
because 1
the 1
manner 1
would 1
be 1
deemed 1
‘inappropriate 1
parliamentary 1
debating’ 1
in 1
their 1
